## Data Package 

```{r}
#Load package from GEO. 
eset <- getGEO("GSE41762", getGPL = FALSE) [[1]]
```

```{r}
#Explore the dataset. 
eset
```
## Analysis 

```{r}
#Explore a subset. 
exprs(eset)[1:5,1:4]
```

```{r}
#Explore the metadata. 
str(pData(eset))
```

This metadata has 40 variables for each of our samples. The BMI information is included in the variable called "bmi:chi." And the status of the participants (whether they have T2D or not) is contained in "status:chi" variable. This R markdown file will focus on exploring the genetic expression in the diabetic vs non-diabetic cohorts. 

```{r}
# Data wrangling.
