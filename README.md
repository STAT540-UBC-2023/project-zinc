# STAT540 Group Project

Welcome to the repository for the Zinc group! For this group project, we initially chose this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5069352/). Data can be found on ArrayExpress with accession numbers: [E-MTAB-5060](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-5060) and [E-MTAB-5061](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-5061?accession=E-MTAB-5061).

We changed our dataset to this one: [GSE41762](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41762). This dataset was used in two papers, one by [Mahdi et al.,(2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23140642/), and the other by [Tang et al., (2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25298321/).
